# Final Project: Circles
DEMO LINK: https://youtube.com/shorts/JsZ9Mu3EfVY

Circles is a photo-sharing social networking app with daily prompts to encourage small groups of families and friends to stay in touch.

Please run this app on an actual device instead of a simulator for the camera function to work. After launching the app, feel free to explore the different groups. The groups have dummy data for the photos (some of them may repeat since I implemented this with an array of 16 photos and choosing one from random on each cell). From the main page, tapping the "Take Picture" button will bring you to the camera. After taking a photo, pressing the "Send" button will upload the photo to firebase. After opening each chat, a new cell with the recently uploaded photo will be created from which the photo can then be seen at the bottom of the collectionview.

Notes/Issues:
- Next version will have captions implemented
